#### 10. Now we will need to edit CloudFormation template (deploymentScript.yaml) that you downloaded from Cloud One console. 

You can use any text editor. In our example we are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

##### 10.1 Open CFT that you downloaded called - deploymentScript.yaml on your IDE

##### 10.2 In the code, search for <code># -- END VTPS CLI</code>

---

##### 10.3 Add the code bellow before the line of the string "# -- END VTPS CLI". These lines are to enable the forward event to the AWS CloudWatch and to use the America EST timezone.

```
  edit

  log
- |
  cloudwatch inspection-event enable
- |
  exit
- |
  commit

  exit

  save-config -y

  gen

  timezone America New_York

  exit

  commit

  exit

```
