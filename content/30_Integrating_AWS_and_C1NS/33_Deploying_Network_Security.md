---

#### 10. Now we will need to edit CloudFormation template (deploymentScript.yaml) that you downloaded from Cloud One console. 

You can use any text editor. In our example we are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

##### 10.1 Open CFT that you downloaded called - deploymentScript.yaml on your IDE

---

##### 10.2 In the code, search for <code># -- END VTPS CLI</code>

---

##### 10.3 Add the code snippet provided **before** the line string **"# -- END VTPS CLI"**. 

- These lines are to enable the event forwarding to AWS CloudWatch and use the America EST timezone.

```
