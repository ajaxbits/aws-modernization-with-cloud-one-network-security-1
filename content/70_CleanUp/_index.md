### Cleanup your Environment

The form of consumption of logs by Cloud One Network Security takes place through third party, you can use any Syslog Server/SIEM but in this case we will use AWS Cloud Watch.

To do it you can read the logs in the Cloud Watch service or we can use a custom Panel in AWS Cloud Watch. For this approach we can deploy another Cloud Formation template.
