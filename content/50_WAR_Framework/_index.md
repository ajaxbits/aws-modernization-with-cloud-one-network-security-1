### Automating AWS Well-Architect Framework for your environment

Now that we completed the integration between AWS and Cloud One - Conformity is time to generate an AWS Well-Architected Framework :bar_chart: :clipboard:
From Cloud One - Conformity Dashboard, we gain new visibility into our AWS environment as well as the capability to generate reports based of the checks and scans ran by the Conformity Bot. To view these checks, select “Browse all Checks” below the compliance summary:

We can begin to filter these checks by Rule, Resource, or the Standard or Framework to which your organization is bound. Since the reports we wish to generate are based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, select “View by Standard or Framework”, then select the AWS Well-Architected Framework from the drop-down menu that appears:

Since the reports we wish to generate are based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, select “View by Standard or Framework”, then select the AWS Well-Architected Framework from the drop-down menu that appears:

Set up a title for the report, after you can just generate a simple report or you can select "Include individual checks" to add more datails to the report, if you do it it can take couple minutes to generate the report depending how big is your environment. After you click "Generate report" we will generate it and you will be able to download either a CSV or PDF version of it. These same steps can be repeated for other standards and frameworks report:
